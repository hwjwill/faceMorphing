# Facemorphing

Facemorphing transforms one's face to the other's in a seamless way. A morph is a simultaneous warp of the image shape and a cross-dissolve of the image colors. The warp is controlled by defining a correspondence between the two pictures through Delaunay Triangulation, and done through affine transformation of each individual triangles. Cross-dissolve is done through weighing colors from the two pictures. Fore more results: http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa16/upload/files/proj5/cs194-26-acm/
